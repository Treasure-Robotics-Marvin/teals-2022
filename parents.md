title: Dear Parent or Guardian

This year your child will participate in an exciting computer science class, offered as part of our partnership with TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools). Through the TEALS partnership, trained volunteers from the technology industry will join Mrs. Nelson's classroom to help teach computer science.

Computing has changed the world in profound ways: it has opened wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. In today's world, it's important for your child to go beyond using computers and smart phones and learn how to solve problems by using technology and writing computer programs. These skills and mindsets will help prepare your child for many possible career paths – not just the tech industry. The website [Careers with Code][careers-with-code] showcases how computer science can lead to amazing opportunities in the areas of art, business, music, medicine, sports, agriculture, gaming, and more.

This survey course offers students a hands-on introduction to computer science. Students will program using a block-based graphical interface as they learn how to translate their ideas into computer programs ("coding"). Students will learn about big ideas in computing such as abstraction and design and will explore various aspects of computing relevant to themselves and to society. There are 7 Big Ideas that students will focus on during this course.

As mentioned above, through the TEALS program, volunteers from the tech industry will participate in this class. Read their short biographies below to learn about these wonderful individuals and how they will help bring their real-world knowledge to our classroom:

> Ben is a software engineer who taught himself to program by making video games in his school library during lunch and after school. He has at different times been employed as an engineer working on machine learning at Amazon, Google, Facebook and most recently Tesla, where he worked on the self-driving team. He comes from a family of teachers - his mom is a Spanish teacher, his dad taught ESL, his sister is a paraeducator, and his brother is a school clerk. In June he moved with his wife from Nashville to New York City.

For success in school, students need support from both the home and school. We know a strong partnership with you will make a big difference in your child’s education. If you have any questions about the curriculum, your child’s academic progress, or his or her behavior in school, please don’t hesitate to contact us. You are welcome to send in a note with your child. The quickest and easiest way to contact us, though, is through e-mail. We check it more often than our voicemail. Please check the course website weekly for homework updates and notices.

Thank you and let’s have a great school year together!

Sincerely,

Mrs. Vinessa Nelson
